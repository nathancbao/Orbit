# Orbit - Overview

## Problem Statement

**Making friends as an adult is hard.**

The loneliness epidemic is one of the most pressing public health challenges of our generation. The U.S. Surgeon General has declared loneliness a national epidemic, with research showing that prolonged social isolation carries health risks equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes per day. Despite being more digitally connected than ever, people—particularly young adults—report having fewer close friendships than previous generations.

The problem is especially acute for:
- **Young professionals** who have relocated for work and lack established social networks
- **College students** navigating new environments and struggling to form meaningful connections beyond surface-level interactions
- **Adults post-college** who find that the structured social environments of school no longer exist

Traditional methods of making friends—through work, school, or existing social circles—are increasingly insufficient. People need a modern, intentional way to build genuine friendships.

## Existing Solutions and Their Limitations

Several apps have attempted to address this problem:

| Solution | Approach | Limitations |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Bumble BFF** | Swipe-based friend matching | One-on-one focus makes it awkward; no group dynamics; matching feels transactional |
| **Meetup** | Event-based gatherings | Large, impersonal groups; intimidating for introverts; no personalized matching |
| **Facebook Groups** | Interest-based communities | Passive engagement; rarely translates to real-world friendships; algorithm-driven content, not connections |
| **Discord** | Online communities | Primarily digital interaction; weak bridge to in-person relationships |

**Common failures across existing solutions:**
1. **Transactional feel** - Swiping on individuals feels like dating, creating awkward dynamics
2. **No group formation** - Friendships often form better in group contexts, not 1-on-1
3. **Event-first, not people-first** - Existing apps focus on activities rather than compatibility
4. **Passive matching** - Users are shown people but given no structured path to actual friendship
5. **No ongoing engagement** - One-time connections with no framework for deepening relationships

## Our Solution: Orbit

Orbit reimagines friend-finding by combining **AI-powered compatibility matching** with **structured social frameworks** that mirror how friendships naturally form.

### Core Features

#### 1. Smart Profiles
Users create rich profiles that go far beyond a simple bio and a few photos. Orbit profiles are designed to capture who you really are and how you like to connect with others.

**What makes a Smart Profile:**
- **Basic Info** - Name, age, and general location to find people nearby
- **Interests & Hobbies** - What you love doing, from hiking to gaming to trying new restaurants
- **Personality Traits** - Are you an introvert who prefers small gatherings, or an extrovert who thrives in bigger groups? Do you like planned activities or spontaneous hangouts?
- **Social Preferences** - How often do you want to meet up? Weekends only, or weekday evenings too? Outdoor adventures or cozy coffee shop chats?
- **Friendship Goals** - Are you looking for a workout buddy, a group to explore the city with, or deeper long-term friendships?

This depth allows Orbit to understand not just *what* you're interested in, but *how* you like to socialize—so we can match you with people who complement your style.

#### 2. Solar System Discovery
Orbit's discovery experience is built around a unique, immersive **solar system metaphor**. Instead of endless swiping or scrolling through lists of profiles, you explore a personalized universe of potential friends.

**How it works:**
- **You are the sun** - Your profile sits at the center of your solar system, represented as a glowing planet
- **Others orbit around you** - Potential friends appear as colorful planets orbiting in concentric rings around you
- **Tap to explore** - Click on any planet to view that person's full profile, see their interests, personality traits, and social preferences
- **Distance reflects compatibility** - Planets closer to you represent higher compatibility matches, while those in outer orbits are still interesting but may have fewer overlapping traits
- **A living universe** - The solar system is animated with twinkling stars and gentle orbital movements, making discovery feel like exploration rather than a chore

**Why a solar system?**
- **It's not a dating app** - The cosmic theme immediately distinguishes Orbit from swipe-based dating apps. You're not judging people in 2 seconds—you're exploring a universe of possibilities
- **Reduces decision fatigue** - Instead of an overwhelming feed, you see a curated set of potential connections in a visually digestible format
- **Encourages curiosity** - The playful interface invites users to tap and explore, lowering the barrier to checking out new profiles
- **Reflects the app's philosophy** - Just like real friendships, the people in your orbit are connected to you but each on their own unique path

This discovery method transforms friend-finding from a tedious task into an engaging experience that users actually want to return to.

#### 3. AI-Powered Matching
Our matching algorithm considers:
- **Interest overlap** - Shared hobbies and passions
- **Personality compatibility** - Complementary social styles
- **Logistics** - Geographic proximity and schedule alignment
- **Friendship goals** - Whether users seek casual hangouts or deeper connections

#### 4. Crews
Crews are small friend groups (3-15 people) formed around shared interests. Unlike one-on-one matching:
- Users can create their own Crews and add friends to it!
- Groups reduce social pressure and awkwardness
- Multiple personalities create natural conversation dynamics
- Shared context provides easy conversation starters
- Regular meetups build familiarity over time

The AI suggests Crew formations and facilitates initial introductions, but users organically build relationships from there.

#### 5. Missions
Missions are one-time events or activities that users can propose or join. They serve as low-commitment entry points:
- Try an activity with a group before committing to a Crew
- Meet people outside your usual circles
- AI suggests Missions based on your interests and nearby opportunities

### Why Orbit Works

**It doesn't feel like dating.**

Other friend-finding apps copy the dating app playbook: swipe right, match, send an awkward first message, hope for the best. That works for romance, but friendships form differently. Orbit takes a group-first approach. Instead of matching you with one stranger and hoping you click, we also have the option of introducing you to small groups of compatible people through Crews and Missions. This takes the pressure off—you're not auditioning for someone's one and only new friend, you're just joining a group hangout.

**There's a clear path from stranger to friend.**

Most apps stop at the match. You get a notification, maybe exchange a few messages, and then... nothing. The connection fizzles. Orbit provides structure: you might start by joining a Mission (a one-time activity with a small group), then if you vibe with those people, you can form or join a Crew together for ongoing hangouts. It's a natural progression that mirrors how friendships actually develop in real life—through repeated, low-pressure interactions over time.

**Matching goes deeper than shared hobbies.**

Sure, you both like hiking. But do you like intense 10-mile treks at dawn, or casual sunset walks with good conversation? Orbit's AI considers not just your interests, but your personality and social style. We match you with people who are genuinely compatible—not just people who checked the same boxes.

**Small groups feel manageable.**

Walking into a Meetup with 50 strangers can be intimidating. Orbit keeps Crews small (3-15 people) so you can actually get to know everyone. It's the difference between a house party where you hide in the corner and a dinner with friends where everyone's part of the conversation.

**Friendships have room to grow.**

One hangout rarely turns into a lasting friendship. Real connections need repeated interaction. Crews give your new friendships a home—a built-in reason to keep meeting up, a group chat to stay connected between hangouts, and shared experiences that become inside jokes and memories.

## Key Measures of Success

Orbit's success will be measured by one fundamental question: **Are people actually making friends?**

We'll track this through:

- **User engagement** - Are people actively participating in Missions and Crews, or just browsing?
- **Real-world meetups** - Are digital connections translating into actual in-person hangouts?
- **Retention** - Do users keep coming back, or does the app collect dust after the first week?
- **User feedback** - When we talk to our users, do they describe their connections as genuine friendships?

The ultimate goal is simple: help people build real, lasting friendships. Everything else is just a means to that end.
