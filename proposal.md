## Elevator Pitch: ##

Finding friends in college shouldn’t feel harder than your STEM classes. Orbit is an iOS app designed to help students connect authentically, plan real-world events, and build lasting social circles—without the awkwardness of traditional social media. Orbit matches students based on shared interests, classes, and availability, then makes it easy to turn those connections into low-pressure hangouts, study groups, or campus events. Safety and trust are built in, with verified student accounts and privacy at the forefront of the design. 

Instead of endless scrolling, Orbit helps students move from online discovery to real connection, making campus life feel smaller, friendlier, and more inclusive.
