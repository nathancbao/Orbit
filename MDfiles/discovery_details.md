Nathan Kotni: (Interviewed by Adrian)
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?
Last time I tried to make a friend was in one of the Graduate CA classes I took. I started a conversation with the person sitting next to me and we slowly started talking after class and becoming friends. 


What was hard about that
I would say it was difficult because in many situations it’s hard to start up a conversation with someone you don’t know especially in environments like classes or work.
Why was that hard
That initial conversation is usually the main roadblock to making new friends as it’s hard to know what to expect since the person is a stranger. Once some familiarity is established between both of you, however, interacting becomes so much more natural.
How do you solve that problem now?
I think I usually approach this problem nowadays by making small talk first, though I wish there was an easier, less stressful way.
Why is that solution not good enough?
The solution is not always good enough, since it is often unclear where we can talk to and interact with people. Some people may be open to interaction and some are not, and it isn’t always clear. 

It can also be awkward and nervewracking, depending on context (there usually has to be a situation to start talking to someone, like a class or club).

What do you want to see out of our app?

I would want to see a good user interface that makes it easy to meet and hang out with people of similar interests. 

Have you used an app to make friends before?
I haven’t used an app to make friends before.

Ahmed: (Interviewed by Adrian)
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?

The last time I tried to make a friend was at the gym when I was socializing with people at the boxing heavy bags. 

What was hard about that
Approaching people who seemed hard at work. They would be occupied with routines and workouts and some want to socialize but some do not. Not easy to tell.
Why was that hard
It was hard trying to find out who wanted to be approached and who did not. And who is friendly and who isn’t.
How do you solve that problem now?
Meeting through different platforms and events where socialization is built in. Such as clubs, town meetup events, and classes instead of open training.
Why is that solution not good enough?
The solution is good but events are inconsistent. It is not easy to always find town and city events (they are an occasional thing). Therefore, a solution with more consistency would be beneficial.

Amed has only used Discord as a friend making app before, but not consistently. He says the server format is good for meeting people and breaking the ice, while one on one conversations can be awkward. I hope that our guilds and mission features can help replicate this feel.

One thing he wants to see from our app is a good discovery feature, to find new people. He thinks tinder swiping is too random and based on looks, which can be superficial.

Lyndsey:
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?
Discord, in class, saw something relatable, sparked convo
What was hard about that
Problems with social anxiety
Why was that hard
It was also hard because I wasn’t used to making friends online and I don’t know how t 
How do you solve that problem now?
I know the people in some of my closer Discord servers and ive already established friendship dynamics
Why is that solution not good enough?
But scheduling is a problem, and building enough trust in people by being IRL can be hard
Problems between different levels:
Underclass men: finding people 
Upperclass men: finding time to hang out with people 


Mark:
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?
Working in a class or in a project
What was hard about that
Scheduling stuff with people is really hard
Why was that hard
There are a lot of questions that are floating around like is this fun? Are we compatible? When are we free?
How do you solve that problem now?
Joining a  club, seeing more of the same faces in classes, and being more confident in reaching out
Why is that solution not good enough?
Some people are just not interested or they don’t want to continue the conversation or hangouts



Christian:
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?
official UCD discord, then went to a specific server and also in the dorms
What was hard about that
There are weirdos online
Why was that hard
Theres a chance that people arent who they say they are.  But for dorms, after freshman year its been harder to make friends and meet people
How do you solve that problem now?
More friends in major already have classes together, same group of people, and just getting over the anxiety slowly
Why is that solution not good enough?
Activities online, other people are not interested, or trying to continue, hard to break people’s shell sometimes, if u wanna schedule but some people cancel, then everyone cancels 





Bryan:
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?
Last week spoke to the person next to me in lecture about a question I had in class
What was hard about that
Speaking to others in class can be hard because they may not be willing to speak, and might be too busy with their work
Why was that hard
I’m an introvert, so it can be daunting to commit to that, and the fear of rejection and it being awkward 
How do you solve that problem now?
I just have to commit to it, and if it happens great, but if it doesn’t its okay 
Why is that solution not good enough?
It all depends on the other person, the situation we’re in, and other factors that are beyond my control. I either talk to them and we exchange social media information and keep on talking, or we don’t 


Jeremy
Tell me about the last time you wanted find friends in college 
Going into college, first year
What was hard about that? hard to find people that understand u
Why was it hard? - Not very social
How do you solve that now? Just had to thug it out
Why is that solution not good enough? If i am not actively in convo, then other person thinks i am not interested, hard for me to talk a lot/be social

Alex

Tell me about the last time you wanted find friends in college 
Going into college, first year
What was hard about that? - Finding people in groups
Why was it hard? - Dont wanna feel like you are begging to be in the FG
How do you solve that now? - Just tried finding people not in a group (1 or 2 people)
Why is that solution not good enough? - Limits your pool of friends

Kyle

Tell me about the last time you wanted find friends in college 
Going into college, first year
What was hard about that? - Aligning interests
Why was it hard? - Try to surround yourself with people who align with my goals, have to get know them past surface level
How do you solve that now? Being more direct, limit testing
Why is that solution not good enough? You can only be so direct before people think you're weird. 


Kyle mentioned that he and others may not use the app because that hed rather meet people naturally






Lauren
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend? - First Year, fall quarter
What was hard about that - Seems like people already had friend groups, introverted, 
Why was that hard - Felt like people were not approachable, difficult of thinking what to say
How do you solve that problem now? - Sliding up on IG stories, harder to start convos face to face
Why is that solution not good enough? - It is really hard because people can not reciprocate and it would be discouraging.


Ben
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?- Freshman year
What was hard about that - Not hard
Why was that hard - Not hard
How do you solve that problem now? -already have friends
Why is that solution not good enough? - it was fine

Jonathan
Tell me about the last you made friends in college?
Freshman year for me
Has there been a time where, like, you struggle to find friends at UC Davis? 
Yeah, for sure. 
What was away, um, that maybe you, like, try to find friends?
 I would say through... maybe social media? 
Have you tried any apps? 
No, but I could see that working, too. 
So let's say there is an app, right? What is the best way for you to make friends within an app? Will it be through, like, interest, hobbies, or, like, maybe just random, or, like, do you want to, like, get matched with people based on preference? 
I think hobbies and interests would be pretty cool. Maybe, like, an accumulation of all of what you said. 
So, going back to the social media aspect, was it helpful or not helpful? 
I wouldn't say it was too hot, but it definitely worked in some aspects, but just, like, introducing myself into, like, a larger audience. But I wouldn't say I was, like, the best thing. 
So, like, did you interact with posts in that regard? 
Yeah, for sure. Well So, was this mainly, like, what year was, I mean, is it was a freshman year? Yeah. That was the main thing. 
Would you be scared to meet random people based on AI matching? 
A little bit, but? I think if we have, like, a mutual interest in, like, coffee a little bit beforehand. Like, kind of seen my personality a little bit, I think I'd be less scared in real life. Okay. So, like, looking at profile would not be enough. You need a little bit of interaction first. Although. 
Besides the app, how did you solve the problem of finding friends?
Through clubs and my Christian fellowship, I connected with others
Was that enough or did you want more?
I would say yes and no. Through the fellowship and clubs, you wil mostly interact with the same group of people pretty frequently, so meeting new people would be difficult still. Those that you meet would be regulars who go on a daily basis already. 

Brooke: (Interviewed by Rashmit)
What was hard about that
Approaching people
Why was that hard
The courage to approach someone also worried about how people are, mostly in person, given a blank stare 
How do you solve that problem now?
Trying to find common ground, for example, both in some of the same organizations 
Why is that solution not good enough?
Just because you find common ground doesnt mean you’ll be friends 

Questions for me:
Why are we different from other apps
Social aspect
You’re not supposed to be spend all the time on the app chatting with people, there’s a reason why chats are temporary
Events and hangouts are ever-changing and ever increasing
We focus on how friendships naturally form
We’re not a platform we’re you can socialize, we’re a platform that guides you in connecting new people, scheduling in-person hangouts, and creating close-bonds with friends beyond the digital realm 
If its for example a girl and a guy who’s making her uncomfy what are somethings that we do to help this
We can have report options
But also because we have people’s campus emails, this provides a deterrent to post absuive/hateful/illegal stuff, and in that sense, be like that
However, we will constantly remind people to be safe, go to events in groups and be weary of 1 on 1 meetups
Have a prompt that says “This is a 1 on 1 meetup, are you sure?”
Or if the amount of people in a group are low in general
What motivations do people have to keep using this app
Gamified system
The ever-changing wave of new missions, new crews, etc
Temporary messages, which means people will have to strive to be clear and concise, and be frequent
Have people think more about the social impacts, not just a ping in a discord channel
What motivations do people have to attend social events
Well meeting people
As said Orbit cant fix everything, people will need to have the motivation to participate, explore, and grow 
Also providing gamified heuristics so people can’t cheat to gain more levels and top the leaderboard 
Can include leaderboards for people but also permanent crews 

Interviewee: Helen
Tell me about the last time you tried to make a friend?
What was hard about that
It was hard finding common interests or topics to discuss.
Why was that hard
I don’t do many hobbies besides studying I just scroll reels and watch anime. It’s hard to discuss things with others who have different hobbies.
How do you solve that problem now?
Find new hobbies or interests and stop being on my phone.
Why is that solution not good enough?
I think it’s enough but even then our interests don’t always match

What do you think is the most important aspect of making friends that's missing? 
Being open-minded and respectful
